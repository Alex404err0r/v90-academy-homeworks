Now, we only bomb brown people – not because they’re trying to cut in on our action – just because they’re brown. 
Now you probably noticed I don’t feel about that war the way we were told we were supposed to feel about that war,
 the way we were ordered and instructed by the United States government to feel about that war. You see, I tell ya,
 my mind doesn’t work that way. I got this real moron thing I do; it’s called “thinking”, and I’m not a very good American
 because I like to form my own opinionsI don’t just roll over when I’m told to. Sad to say, most Americans just roll over on command, not me.
 I have certain rules I live by; my first rule: I don’t believe anything the government tells me… nothing, zero, no,
 and I don’t take very seriously, the media or the press in this country, who in the case of the Persian Gulf war were nothing more than unpaid employees of the Department of Defence, and who most of the time, most of the time functioned as kind of an unofficial public relations agency for the United States government. So I don’t listen to them, I don’t really believe in my country and I gotta tell you folks, I don’t get all choked up about yellow ribbons and American flags. I consider them to be symbols and I leave symbols to the symbol-minded.
